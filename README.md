## About
This was an assignment to train a multi-class classifier to classify a speech command using speech data. The provided dataset contains 30 different categories of commands.
My task is to train a classifier that classifies this data.
I  was provided with a pytorch dataset reader called `gcommand dataset.py`  .
I also describe my modelâ€™s architecture and explain how I chose it and all hyper-parameters in `ex 5 report.pdf` .
